Based on your code and the calculator image you've shared, here's a comprehensive `requirements.txt` file that includes all the necessary dependencies for your Casio fx-991EX ClassWiz Advanced calculator simulator:

```
# Core requirements
tkinter>=8.6
numpy>=1.21.0
scipy>=1.7.0
matplotlib>=3.4.0
pillow>=8.3.0  # For potential image handling

# Development/testing requirements
pytest>=6.2.0
black>=21.0
flake8>=3.9.0
mypy>=0.900

# Optional (for enhanced features)
pyperclip>=1.8.0  # For improved clipboard handling
qrcode>=7.0  # For QR code generation (if you implement it fully)
```

### Notes about the requirements:

1. **Core Requirements**:
   - `tkinter` comes with Python by default (no need to install separately)
   - `numpy` and `scipy` are used for advanced math operations and matrix calculations
   - `matplotlib` is used for any potential plotting functionality
   - `pillow` is included in case you add image handling features

2. **Development Requirements**:
   - These are useful if you plan to continue developing the project
   - Can be installed with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` if you separate them

3. **Optional Requirements**:
   - `pyperclip` provides more robust clipboard handling than tkinter's built-in
   - `qrcode` would be needed if you implement actual QR code generation

### Additional recommendations:

1. You might want to create a `setup.py` file for easier installation:
```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="fx991ex-calculator",
    version="1.0",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        "numpy>=1.21.0",
        "scipy>=1.7.0",
        "matplotlib>=3.4.0",
        "pillow>=8.3.0",
    ],
    extras_require={
        "dev": [
            "pytest>=6.2.0",
            "black>=21.0",
            "flake8>=3.9.0",
            "mypy>=0.900",
        ],
        "full": [
            "pyperclip>=1.8.0",
            "qrcode>=7.0",
        ],
    },
)
```

2. Consider adding a `.gitignore` file for Python projects to exclude unnecessary files from your GitHub repository.

3. You might want to add a `README.md` file explaining how to install and use your calculator simulator.
